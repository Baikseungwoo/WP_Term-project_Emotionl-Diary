## 🔐 Environment Variables

To run this project locally, your`.env` file in the root directory is essential in running GPT API.  
You can start by copying the `.env.example` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```
If you don't have an API key and want to test the project, feel free to contact me — hyunmin43240@gmail.com <br>
I can provide you with a temporary key for testing purposes.
